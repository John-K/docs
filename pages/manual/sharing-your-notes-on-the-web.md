Publishing notes on the web comes in handy if you are working on a team project or just passing along useful tips to friends.
It allows you to share your Markdown notes with anyone, even those who don't use Inkdrop.

## Steps to Publish Notes

First, open a note you wish to publish and then click “Share Note” button on the top right corner of the window.
